We often neglect some easy problems only to witness that it appears during interview and unable to optimise either $\text{time complexity}$ or $\text{space complexity}$. Not anymore, if you observed interview experience sources you would probably came to notice that nearly 90% of them are predictable.
Objective of this blog is to compile all such in one space and make you interview ready. _Please note that this is targeted for below or equal to 8LPA CTC roles_ 

### MustDo-1: Project you mentioned in resume
`YOUR RESUME IS YOUR QUESTION PAPER!!!` \\
Whatever you mentioned in the resume that will be questioned not outside if not you bringing catchy technical words. If you are mentioned more about _Machine Learning_ then your interview will be on that aspect of field. 

What actually they look in project?
Merely how you worked on it and how did you put your ideas into that project but not the tool you used. Your talk should be focused more on process and  on challenges you solved. Start in sequence like first start with Objective, why this project, process, how did you implemented ideas, challenges, what you learnt.

Follow up questions can be expected are: 
1. what new thing you done which keeps apart from others 
2. what is backend database(expect question on database) 
3. how did you deployed it


### MustDo-2: Object Oriented Programming
Direct Questions, no bla... bla... bla...
1. 4 Pillar of OOP (Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsultion)
2. Write code for Inheritance
  - Follow up questions
    - Overriding/overloading

Now it depends on which language you are asked to type 
if:
  - Python:
    - Can encapsulation be achieved?
    - Why is the `self` keyword used but not explicitly passed in a method?
    - How are constructors and destructors handled?
  - Java:
    - First of all, it's unpredictable; expect a wide range of questions.
  - C++:
    - Singleton function
    - Virtual function
    - Pointers, super pointers, `this` keyword
    - Diamond ambiguity
    - Multiple inheritance


This is one strong topic in which interviewer tries to filter out candidate. So be thorough with this one concepts as well as programming in efficient oop.

### MustDo-3: MySQL Programming and DBMS Concepts
Predictable questions:
1. Joins and their types
2. what is transactions and ACID Property
3. Stored Procedure and triggers
4. Indexing and working principle of BIT (rare)
5. Delete vs Truncate
6. Rank() vs Dense_rank()

Programming Questions:
So far I gave interview, i only came across a only one platform in mysql and same database. It is [coderpad](https://coderpad.io/) platform. I think you need to work on that, use chatgpt to generate different question for that database (inside talk, even interivewer generate question from chatgpt as it comes with integrated chatgpt) 

### MustDo-4: Basic working principles of certain DSA
Direct questions:
1. DFS vs BFS
2. Stack vs Queue
3. Red-black tree/ AVL tree
4. linked-list vs array
5. hashmaps

### MustDo-5: Technical coding problem
