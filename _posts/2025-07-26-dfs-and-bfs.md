### Walking in the graph universe

Nodes are connected one and other and whole connected graph forms component. We can take a node as starting-node and traverse whole graph component which are adjacent to each other but how we traverse that gives us so much meaning to applications. Here we have two choices to walk in graph that is, either by breadth-wise or depth-wise. What we can interpeted by breadth-wise is that, it is level-wise
