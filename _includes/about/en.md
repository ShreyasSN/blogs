# Hi there, Shreyas here...

I'm originally from Karnataka and did my schooling at **Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Kannur**, deep in the hills of Kerala. Later, I studied **Computer Science and Engineering** at **NIT Calicut** where I slowly realized I really enjoy solving hard problems with code and data.

Over the years, I’ve drifted between a few different worlds including competitive **programming**, full-stack **web dev**, and **data science.** I’ve spent time building websites with React and Node, diving into ML models with TensorFlow and PyTorch, and exploring data through tools like Power BI. Ahh yea... I know it’s a weird mix, but I like it that way.

I also hang out on coding platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/shreyas_s_n/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/shreyas_s_n) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/shreyassn), and once in a while, I dive into open-source projects (GSSOC, Hacktoberfest) or take on some Kaggle challenges for fun.

Academically, I’ve cleared **GATE** (in both DS & AI and CS), and earlier, **JEE Mains**. I’ve studied the usual CS topics—systems, networks, databases but what really clicks for me is building things that are smart and useful.

If I had to sum it up... I like working with messy data, clean code, and creative people.
